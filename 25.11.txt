started to seperate positive and negative tweets before tokenizing them to words
now on file positive_smily_detector.py, it saves positive tweets on data/feature_list/positive_list/positive_tweets.txt
it applied to original tweets which are in data/feature-Output.txt
list of positive smilys are in data/feature_list/positive_Smilies.txt

we have 132 positive tweets

the same for negative tweets

we have 32 negative tweets

so 

started again to first filter text then remove stop words and so
