Today I started to extract just the original tweets of a table taula4bitdefault which has been collected on mysql
the reason that I ddin't use Mongodb collection was that, for extracting original tweets ( not retweets ) to csv or txt, I 
still have a problem with non-ascii characters and it has Error. 
But with help of Phpmyadmin, 

SELECT tweet FROM `taula4bitdefault` WHERE tweet NOT LIKE "RT%"

I could now collect just the original tweets in the txt format which is located in THesis/twitter API/tweepy
 
First I extraxted csv file from phpmyadmin, the opened it with note pad and saved it as txt. the reseason is because 
each line is now presented in new line. (TODO) try to extract txt dirextly with ability of adding each one in new line

from here (started in 25.11.txt)

next: filtering the text : removing URL, and ....

Started to extract features from text. here are steps


1. Lower Case - Convert the tweets to lower case.
2. URLs - I don't intend to follow the short urls and determine the content of the site, 
so we can eliminate all of these URLs via regular expression matching or replace with generic word URL.
3. @username - we can eliminate "@username" via regex matching or replace it with generic word AT_USER.
4. #hashtag - hash tags can give us some useful information, so it is useful to replace them with the exact same word without the hash.
 E.g. #nike replaced with 'nike'.
5. Punctuations and additional white spaces - remove punctuation at the start and ending of the tweets. 
 E.g: ' the day is beautiful! ' replaced with 'the day is beautiful'. It is also helpful to replace multiple whitespaces with a single whitespace

the code is on twitter-text-features.py and the result which is based on data that has queried from phpmyadmin is stored in data/feature-Output.txt

update of 25.11.txt : 

data/feature_list/negative_list/feature-Output.txt
and 
data/feature_list/positive_list/feature-Output.txt
